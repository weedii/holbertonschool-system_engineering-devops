1- Three Firewalls:
    Firewalls are added to protect the servers from unauthorized access and to control incoming and outgoing traffic. They help enforce security policies, block malicious requests, and act as a barrier between the internet and the servers.


2- SSL Certificate:
    An SSL certificate is installed on the load balancer to enable HTTPS communication between the users and the website. It encrypts the traffic, ensuring secure data transmission and protecting sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and personal data.


3- Three Monitoring Clients:
    Monitoring clients, such as Sumo Logic or other monitoring services, are deployed to collect and analyze data about the infrastructure's performance and health. They monitor various metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and server response times, providing insights into the system's operation and helping identify and resolve issues proactively.


4- Load Balancer:
    The load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming traffic across the web servers, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and improving website performance and availability. It acts as a single entry point for users and performs SSL termination, decrypting HTTPS traffic and forwarding it to the appropriate web server.


To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second):

To monitor the web server's QPS, the monitoring tool can collect and analyze the web server's access logs. These logs contain information about each request, including timestamps, requested URLs, and response codes. By aggregating and analyzing this data, the monitoring tool can calculate the average number of queries served per second, providing insights into the web server's load and performance.

1- Terminating SSL at the load balancer level:
    Terminating SSL at the load balancer means decrypting the HTTPS traffic at the load balancer before forwarding it to the web servers. While this allows the load balancer to offload SSL processing from the web servers, it also means that the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is transmitted in plain HTTP. This can pose a security risk if the internal network is compromised or if the communication between the load balancer and web servers is not adequately protected.


2- Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes:
    Having a single MySQL server capable of accepting writes can be a single point of failure. If this server goes down or experiences issues, it can result in the website being unavailable or data loss. To address this, it is recommended to have a MySQL replication setup with a master-slave configuration, where multiple servers can accept writes and replicate data to ensure redundancy and high availability.


3- Servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server):
    Having servers with all the same components can be a problem because it creates a single point of failure for each component. If a particular component fails, such as the database server, the entire server becomes non-functional. To improve fault tolerance, it is advisable to distribute components across different servers and employ load balancing techniques to handle high traffic and improve reliability.
